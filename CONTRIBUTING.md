For consistency with PsychoPy, use the following tags before commit/PR messages:

- **BF:** bug fix. For fixing bugs in the *release* branch.
- **FF:** ‘feature’ fix. For fixing bugs in the *dev* branch.
- **RF:** refactoring
- **NF:** new feature
- **ENH:** enhancement (to existing code, but don't worry too much about the difference between this and NF)
- **DOC:** for all kinds of documentation related commits
- **TEST:** for adding or changing tests
